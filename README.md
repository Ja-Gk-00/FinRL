# FinRL
The project focuses on the usage of the reinforcement learning techniques in the finance field.  
For given financial **environment**, we will select a certain **agent** who will perform under selected **strategy** in order to maximize the benefit coming from the **strategy** (in short optimize the profit from given stocks).

## Installation
*To be defined*

## Requirements
In order to install our bot, the following requirements must be met:
    - Have computer
    - Be smart
    - Like dinozaurs (all above are of course temporary placeholders :D)


## Strategies, Agents and Environments
The crucial part of our system is the selection of **Strategies**, **Agents** and **Environments**.  

### Agent
Agent represents decision making object in our financial setup, the agent will be trained on data in a given environment and will follow a certain strategy to maximize profit for given stock data.  
There will be several classes of the agents, which will follow:  
    - AgentSimple
    - *Placeholder*
    - *Placeholder*
    - *Placeholder*
    - *Placeholder*

### Strategy
Strategy will be an implicitly given set of instructions in the optimization process for the agent. In some instances, the usage of meta data and meta knowledge may significantly improve the performance of the agent.  
The featured strategies will include:
    - *Paceholder*
    - *Paceholder*
    - *Paceholder*
    - *Paceholder*
    - *Paceholder*

### Environment
Environment will be asociated with the flow of data, its shape, the frequency of its update and the overall of the behaviour of the observed stock market.  
The evnironments will be related to the observed stock, which will include:
    - *Placeholder*
    - *Placeholder*
    - *Placeholder*
    - *Placeholder*
